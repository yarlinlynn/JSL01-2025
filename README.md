> JSL01 Challenge Brief: Kanban Board UI Implementation:

This project involves developing a **visually accurate and fully responsive Kanban board** that aligns with the provided **Figma design**. The board should be structured into multiple columns and include task cards, a static side panel, and a well-defined theme to ensure a **professional and polished user experience.**


## Key Objectives

- [x] Implement a **favicon and page title** that match the application’s theme for a professional look.
- [x] Create a **Kanban board with multiple columns** (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done") that **exactly replicates** the Figma design layout.
- [x] Ensure the **board’s layout, colours, typography, and spacing** strictly follow the Figma specifications for visual consistency.
- [x] Develop a **fully responsive** board that adapts seamlessly to **both laptops and mobile devices**, mirroring the Figma design’s responsive behavior.
- [x] Display **tasks as individual cards** within their respective columns, ensuring their design (borders, shadows, padding) follows the Figma guidelines for clarity and appeal.
- [x] Include **titles on all task cards** to provide clear task descriptions.
- [x] Implement a **static side panel (in desktop view)** with the correct **icons, text, and branding elements** as per the Figma layout for a structured and professional appearance.
